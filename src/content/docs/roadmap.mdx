# Code Snapshots Roadmap - Simple Snapshot Management

This document outlines the future plans for the Code Snapshots extension, emphasizing **dead simple snapshot creation and management** that complements Git.

## Core Principles: Keeping it Simple

- **Simplicity First**: Easy to use, minimal setup.
- **Low Mental Overhead**: No complex workflows to learn.
- **Git-Friendly**: Enhances Git, doesn't replace it.
- **Immediate Value**: Features provide instant benefit to your coding.
- **Fast Performance**: Quick operations that don't slow you down.

## Current Status (v0.9.0 Features) - Feature Checklist

#### Snapshot Basics:

- [x] One-key snapshot creation (`Ctrl+Alt+S`)
- [x] Snapshot navigation (forward/backward: `Ctrl+Alt+N` / `Ctrl+Alt+B`)
- [x] Time-based grouping in Explorer views
- [x] Status bar indicator

#### Working with Snapshots:

- [x] File comparison (Diff View)
- [x] Single file restoration
- [x] Selective snapshots

#### Automation & Efficiency:

- [x] Time-based auto-snapshots
- [x] Rule-based auto-snapshots
- [x] UI for rule management
- [x] Editor Gutter Indicators
- [x] Differential storage
- [x] Content caching
- [x] Async file I/O

#### Context & Organization:

- [x] Snapshot context: Tags, Notes, Task References, Favorites
- [x] Edit snapshot context via Tree View
- [x] Filtering by Date, Tags, Favorites, Path
- [x] Filter status bar
- [x] `.gitignore` / `.snapshotignore` support

#### Git Integration:

- [x] Store Git branch/commit info
- [x] Create Git commit from snapshot
- [x] Auto-snapshot before pull/merge/rebase

#### Getting Started:

- [x] Welcome Tour and Getting Started command
