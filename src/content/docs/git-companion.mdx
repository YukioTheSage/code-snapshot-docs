# Code Snapshots and Git: Perfect Companions

This guide explains how to effectively use Code Snapshots alongside Git for an optimal development workflow.

## Two Tools, Different Purposes

**Git** is designed for:

- Formal version control with logical commits
- Team collaboration
- Code sharing and distribution
- Long-term project history
- Branching and merging features
- Remote backups and synchronization

**Code Snapshots** is designed for:

- Personal development workflow
- Rapid experimentation & quick reverts
- Work-in-progress protection ("micro-commits")
- Moment-in-time captures without polluting Git history
- Quick navigation between recent development states
- Minimal-overhead versioning for individual workstreams
- Capturing state _before_ complex Git operations

## When to Use Each Tool

### Use Code Snapshots When:

- **Experimenting with code** — Take quick snapshots as you try different approaches (`Ctrl+Alt+S`).
- **Between Git commits** — Create frequent checkpoints as you work toward your next commit.
- **Learning or exploring unfamiliar code** — Snapshot before making changes.
- **Before risky operations** — Snapshot before Git operations like `merge`, `rebase`, or `pull`.
- **During debugging sessions** — Capture states while tracking down bugs.
- **Quick safety net** — One keystroke for peace of mind.
- **Personal "save points"** — Checkpoints outside Git history.
- **Refactoring** — Snapshot before and after major changes.

### Use Git When:

- **Completing a logical feature/fix** — Commit meaningful, testable changes.
- **Sharing code with teammates** — Push your commits.
- **Creating releases** — Tag milestones.
- **Parallel development** — Use branches.
- **Open source contributions** — Make pull requests.
- **Documenting project history** — Craft clear commit messages.
- **Remote backup** — Push to remote repos.

## Ideal Combined Workflow

1. **Start with Git** — Clone your repo and check out the branch.
2. **Snapshot before changes** — `Ctrl+Alt+S` with a description like "Clean state from git pull".
3. **Work and snapshot frequently** — Every 15–30 minutes or after major changes.
4. **Commit to Git when ready** — After passing tests.
5. **Snapshot before Git network ops** — `pull`, `merge`, `rebase`. Enable auto-snapshot for this.
6. **Sync with Git** — Pull teammate changes, resolve conflicts.
7. **Repeat** — Continue the cycle.

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Experimental Feature Development

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-widget
```

- Snapshot: `Ctrl+Alt+S` → "Start feature/new-widget"
- Try Approach A with snapshots.
- Restore to original snapshot if needed.
- Try Approach B with snapshots.
- Final snapshot → "Approach B - complete with tests"
- Stage & commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement new widget using Approach B"
git push origin feature/new-widget
```

### Scenario 2: Bug Fixing

- Checkout bug branch → Snapshot: "Buggy state for issue #123"
- Add debug logs, test fixes with snapshots
- Restore and retry if a fix fails
- Implement the correct fix only, then:

```bash
git add <fixed_file>
git commit -m "fix: resolve null pointer exception in calculation\n\nCloses #123"
```

### Scenario 3: Code Review Changes

- Snapshot: "Before addressing PR #45 feedback"
- Take snapshots for each change
- Restore and retry as needed
- Commit changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit --amend
# or
git commit -m "chore: address code review feedback for PR #45"
git push --force-with-lease
```

### Scenario 4: Promoting a Snapshot to a Commit

- Identify desired snapshot
- Right-click → **Create Git Commit from Snapshot**
- Edit pre-filled commit message
- Confirm restore process
- Changes are staged and committed automatically:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement new widget using Approach B"
```

## Tips for Integration

1. **Use meaningful snapshot descriptions** referencing Git context.
2. **Snapshot before Git operations** like `pull`, `merge`, `rebase`, etc.
3. **Enable auto-snapshot** before Git ops via `vscode-snapshots.git.autoSnapshotBeforeOperation`.
4. **Set up rule-based auto-snapshots** for important files.
5. **Clean up old snapshots** once committed to Git.
6. **Use Git for collaboration**, Snapshots for personal safety.
7. **Enrich snapshot context** with tags, task refs, and notes.

## Conclusion

Git and Code Snapshots are **complementary tools**. Git handles formal versioning and collaboration, while Snapshots offer lightweight safety and flexibility. Used together, they provide a complete development safety net and history navigation toolkit.
