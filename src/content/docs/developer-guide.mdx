# Code Snapshots - Developer Guide

This document provides technical details, architecture information, and contribution guidelines for the Code Snapshots VS Code extension. It's intended for developers who want to understand, modify, or extend the extension.

## Architecture Overview

Code Snapshots follows a modular architecture with clearly separated components:

![Architecture Diagram](images/architecture-diagram.png)

### Key Components

Each core module is described, including `extension.ts`, `commands.ts`, `snapshotManager.ts`, and more. These components cover:

- Activation logic
- Command registration
- Snapshot creation/restoration
- File system storage
- UI interactions (Tree View, Quick Pick, Status Bar)
- Change detection and decoration

## Data Storage

Snapshots are stored in the `.snapshots/` directory and include:

```text
.snapshots/
├── index.json
├── snapshot-*/
│   └── snapshot.json
```

![Storage Structure Diagram](images/storage-structure-diagram.png)

Snapshot data includes metadata, tags, notes, Git info, and file diffs or full content.

## Core Algorithms

### Snapshot Creation

Outlines the full process from file collection to diffing, saving, and in-memory indexing.

### Snapshot Restoration

Describes restoring files, handling conflicts, restoring editor state, and progress tracking.

### File Content Resolution

Explains cache usage, recursive diff application, and binary file handling.

### File Exclusion Logic

Summarizes `.gitignore` and `.snapshotignore` parsing, glob conversion, and VS Code file filtering.

## Error Handling

Describes snapshot recovery, user feedback, conflict dialogs, and async error management.

## Performance Considerations

Highlights include:

- Async file I/O
- Differential storage
- In-memory caching
- Efficient UI responsiveness
- Debounced editor decoration

## Extension Points & Future Enhancements

Includes potential support for:

- Cloud-based backends
- Timeline view UI
- Snapshot branching/merging
- Deeper Git/task integrations

## Contributing to Code Snapshots

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vscode-snapshots.git
cd vscode-snapshots
npm install
code .
```

Use `F5` to launch the extension dev host.

### Project Structure

```text
vscode-snapshots/
├── src/
│   ├── ui/
│   ├── utils/
│   ├── *.ts
├── images/
├── docs/
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

### Guidelines

- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use strong typing and interfaces
- Separate UI, logic, and storage responsibilities
- Prefer dependency injection

### Testing

- Use Jest or Mocha with mocks
- Cover `SnapshotManager`, `SnapshotStorage`, and utility functions

```bash
npm test
```

### Pull Requests

- Fork → Branch → Commit → PR → Review
- Follow commit message conventions (Conventional Commits)

Example:
```text
feat(storage): add content caching
```

### Documentation

Keep `README.md`, user and dev guides, and JSDoc comments updated.

## Key Implementation Details

### Asynchronous Operations

```ts
const content = await fsPromises.readFile(absolutePath, "utf8");
```

### State Management

- `SnapshotManager` maintains snapshots and state
- `SnapshotTreeDataProvider` handles filters

### Event System

Uses `vscode.EventEmitter` for snapshot changes and UI refreshes.

## Appendix: API Reference

Describes public classes and interfaces including `SnapshotManager`, `SnapshotStorage`, and `SnapshotTreeDataProvider`. See full code for exact signatures.

## Filtering Architecture

Outlines how snapshot filters (date, tags, etc.) are maintained independently per view, updated via commands, and reflected in the status bar.
